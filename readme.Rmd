# Determining sperm whale sex from morphometric measurements

## Summary
I have a dataset that has the average morphometric measurements (total length and nose to body ratio R.hf)
of sperm whales. I do not know the age or sex of the individuals. But I know that, at about 6m long, 
the growth curves that relate total length to nose-to-body-ratio diverge for males and females.
Specifically, while females (who range from 3.6 -12 m) follow a simple logistic curve in which the
nose-to-body ratio realizes its asymptote. Conversely, the male nose-to-body ratio continues 
to increase nearly linearly with size (which ranges from 3.6 to 17 m).


## Aims
1. Estimate the parameters for the male and female curves based on the data
2. Estimate the posterior probability that each observed individual is a female
3. Estimate credible intervals for curve parameters and posterior probabilities


## Data 

The project has the following directory structure:
