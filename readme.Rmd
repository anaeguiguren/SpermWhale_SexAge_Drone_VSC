# Determining sperm whale sex from morphometric measurements

## Summary
I have a dataset that has the average morphometric measurements (total length and nose to body ratio R.hf)
of sperm whales. I do not know the age or sex of the individuals. But I know that, at about 6m long, 
the growth curves that relate total length to nose-to-body-ratio diverge for males and females.
Specifically, while females (who range from 3.6 -12 m) follow a simple logistic curve in which the
nose-to-body ratio realizes its asymptote. Conversely, the male nose-to-body ratio continues 
to increase nearly linearly with size (which ranges from 3.6 to 17 m).


## Aims
1. Estimate the parameters for the male and female curves based on the data
2. Estimate the posterior probability that each observed individual is a female
3. Estimate credible intervals for curve parameters and posterior probabilities

## Data methodology
Implement a Bayesian modelling approach

## Tech context
- We will use the R program
- tidyverse packages for data manipulation
- ggplot2 for data visualization

Keep your scripts short and modular to facilitate debugging. Don't complete all of the steps below in one script. Finish scripts where it makes sense and save intermediate datasets.
